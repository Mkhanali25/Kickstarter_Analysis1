# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 
## Overview of Project
In this project we took a look at various campaings and how they managed to fair against one another. We looked at many different points of data to help us conclude which campaigns were the most successfull, least, and which of them failed. With this information we can see which campaigns will continue production and which of them will be tabled. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this experiment was to determine how Louise's play Fever fared in relation to the other campaigns. We used data like funding goals, launch dates, outcomes, etc. to determine which campaigns were the most successful. 
## Analysis and Challenges
After completing the assignment and inspecting the data I could draw some conclusions as to why the data looks the way it does. When we were comparing launch dates we could see through the graph that a certain month faired better than the rest. We could also determine which month was the worst as well. ![Theater_outcomes_Vs_Launch](https://github.com/Mkhanali25/Kickstarter_Analysis1/blob/master/Images/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png). When comparing the outcomes based on goals we can determine which plays did better according to their goals. We can conclude that those campaigns with lower goals faired better than those with high goals.![Outcomes_Vs_Goals](path/to/Outcomes_Vs_Goals.png).
The most challenging aspect of this project was trying to navigate through excel. Since the file size was relatively large, my computer would freeze while I was working on the project. Besides that little hiccup the exercise was easy because we had already had some practice messing around with the file. The videos provided were extremely helpful because they practically showed you what you needed to do and how it was supposed to be done. When I first started the module I would take a shortcut by not copying the new column all the way down so I had all the data. Instead I would only take it down about 500 cells. Later that ended up with me wasting more time than saving it because I had to go back and fill all 4000 cells.
### Analysis Based on Launch date
Based off the data that we have we can conclude multiple things that correlate between launch date and success. By looking at the data we can conclude that in the month of May the amount of plays were significantly higher as well as more successful. May by far had the most success than any other month. Even though the month of May had the most success it also had the most failed plays as well. Another month to look at is December, we can conclude that it by far is the month that you wouldn't want to release your play in. We can see that the amount of success and failures are neck and neck.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The outcomes based on goals revealed a lot about the data set. By looking at it we can conclude that the higher the goal is the harder it will be to become successful. The two most successful categories were the two lowest ones. The less that 1000 and 1000-4999 categories were the two most successful. The data proves that the lower the goal the higher the success rate.
## Results
The data in this set showed us a good representation of the varaibles we were looking at. There were many variables that we didn't incorporate for example country, currency, deadline etc. These are all lurking variables that could play and effect on our data if they were encorporated. This is a limitation that is common with many exercises. Variables are often left out to skew data a certain direction, in our case we just didn't encorporate it. A graph that we could've used was a box and whisker plot, by using that graph we could see what outliers skewed the data in which direction.
